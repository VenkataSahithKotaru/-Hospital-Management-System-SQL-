# 🏥 Project Overview – Hospital Management System (SQL)

This project simulates a Hospital Management System using structured, multi-table healthcare data. The goal is to analyze hospital operations — including patient management, doctor performance, appointments, treatments, and billing — through SQL-based data analysis.

Five interconnected datasets (patients, doctors, appointments, treatments, and billing) were cleaned, validated, and analyzed using SQL queries. The project focuses on deriving actionable insights such as patient flow trends, revenue generation, and payment patterns.

Through the use of Joins, Subqueries, AggregateFunctions, and Case Statements, this project demonstrates practical data-handling and analytical skills applied to a real-world healthcare scenario.

The dataset used in this project simulates a hospital management system and consists of five interrelated tables — patients, doctors, appointments, treatments, and billing. Each table contains specific information: patients.csv includes demographic and insurance details, doctors.csv provides doctor profiles and specializations, appointments.csv records patient-doctor visit schedules and statuses, treatments.csv contains information about medical procedures and costs, and billing.csv stores payment details and billing statuses. Together, these datasets offer a comprehensive view of hospital operations, enabling relational analysis and data-driven insights through SQL.
# 💡 Outcome:
Efficiently managed and analyzed hospital data to identify key operational insights, improve reporting accuracy, and support data-driven decision-making in healthcare.
